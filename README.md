# hello-world

OK, here i can write my README.md

I think with mark-down.
Let's try a list
- first
- second
- and some **very important** note

Learn about Markdown: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/),
[Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Syntax (not only for hyperlinks) is the same as with [Stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)? 

Wow: Emojis at your fingertips :sunglasses: see http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/

And feature-lists are great:
- [ ] Learn everything about github
- [x] create first repository
- [x] do some experiments with the `README.md`
- [x] clone and push from remote
- [ ] push without the need to give credentials
